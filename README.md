# 🔢 C++ Experiment 1: Hello World & Basic Calculator

## 🎯 Aim

- ✅ Write a C++ program to print **"Hello, World!"**
- ✅ Build a simple calculator to perform **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- 📌 Understand the structure and flow of a basic C++ program  
- 📌 Learn to use `cout` for output and `cin` for user input  
- 📌 Understand the purpose of `using namespace std;`  
- 📌 Use `//` to write meaningful comments for better code clarity  

---

## 📝 Program Explanation

- `#include <iostream>`: Adds input-output functionality
- `using namespace std;`: Lets us use standard library features like `cout` and `cin` without prefixing `std::`
- `int main()`: Entry point of every C++ program
- `return 0;`: Indicates successful program execution
- `cout`: Prints output to the console
- `cin`: Takes input from the user
- `//`: Used for single-line comments
- Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` are used for calculations
- `float`: Stores decimal number inputs
- Every statement ends with a semicolon `;`
